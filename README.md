## Privacy policy

Full version: https://luizfbalves.github.io/verso/en/privacy.html (Português: https://luizfbalves.github.io/verso/privacidade.html)

This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it.

To do its job, Verso sends the following requests:

- **LRCLIB** (https://lrclib.net): the title, artist, album and duration of the track playing in Spotify or YouTube Music, to fetch synced lyrics.
- **Verso translation server** ([proxy/](proxy/), a Cloudflare Worker): only if the user turns on translation. The lyric lines are forwarded to Microsoft Azure Translator and the result is kept in a shared cache with no user identifiers. The client IP is used only for rate limiting, hashed, in counters that expire within two days.

No analytics or telemetry is collected.
